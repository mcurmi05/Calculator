Cheeky calculator app I developed to practice my new javascript skills. Learnt a few new techniques in the process, used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop this calculator.
This project taught me how important it was to not fix the size of things in pixels too often to maintain a responsive webpage, since by the time I was done I realised how bad it looks on other devices.
